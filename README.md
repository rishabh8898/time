# Singularity_time_calculator

Purpose of my Software:
my software, based on tube theory calculations, aims to explore the effects of 4D spacetime curvature on local time.
While it currently focuses on Earth-based coordinates, it could potentially be extended to interstellar scenarios.
Researchers, physicists, or anyone curious about theoretical physics and time dilation might find my software intriguing.
