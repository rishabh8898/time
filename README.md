Purpose of my Software:
my software, based on tube theory calculations, aims to explore the effects of 4D spacetime curvature on local time.
While it currently focuses on Earth-based coordinates, it could potentially be extended to interstellar scenarios.
Researchers, physicists, or anyone curious about theoretical physics and time dilation might find my software intriguing.

Adjusted Time:
The adjusted time refers to the modified local time at a specific location due to various factors, such as gravitational effects, relativistic phenomena, or other physical influences.
In your context of tube theory, it represents the time adjustment based on the curvature of 4D spacetime. As mass distribution and velocity affect this curvature, the local solar time is altered accordingly.
Essentially, it’s the time you would observe at a given location after accounting for these effects.

Velocity:
Velocity is a fundamental concept in physics, representing the rate of change of an object’s position with respect to time.
It can be described as the speed of an object in a specific direction.
In my program, velocity plays a role in determining the influence of 4D curvature on 3D space. Higher velocities may lead to more significant adjustments in local time.

Mass Distribution:
Mass distribution refers to how mass (or matter) is distributed within a region of space.
In my context, it affects the curvature of spacetime. Objects with mass (like planets, stars, or black holes) warp the fabric of spacetime around them.
The distribution of mass influences the strength of gravitational fields and, consequently, the local time adjustment.
